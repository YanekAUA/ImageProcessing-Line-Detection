# Text Line Recognition Project
<!-- 
The Project aims at detection / recognition of stone inscriptions. Due to weathering, vandalism,
erosion, and the complexity of ancient scripts, many of these texts are hard to read. Study, apply
and test Image Processing methods and algorithms to detect Armenian inscriptions.
The shapes of Armenian letters are based on vertical strokes. Based on this observation, implement
and test a pipeline outlined below. Implement the steps as ImageJ plug-ins or menu commands,
and save them using the ImageJ macro recorder. In addition to the recorded macro(s), submit the
code of all implemented plug-ins. Other image processing and programming environments may
be used only for testing purposes. -->

| **1**  | Select several images of **tombstones (tapanakars), cross-stones (khachkars), or monuments with Armenian inscriptions**. Make them **grayscale** and process as outlined below.                                                                                                                                                       | The image files and source links.                                               |                                             ✅ [path to images](./images)                                             |
| **2**  | **Detect the vertical edges** (both east and west edges) using **Edge Detection Operators** (Chapter 6). Make the images of the detected edges **binary**. **Combine** the detected east and west edges in a binary image.                                                                                                            | Kernels of the edge operators and the images of east, west, and combined edges. | Kernels and edge operators are in the macro called [vertical-edges.java(actually ijm)](./macros/vertical-edges.java) |
| **3**  | **Strengthen the detected vertical edges** by applying **1 pixel-wide dilation in horizontal direction** and **1 pixel-wide erosion in vertical direction** (Chapter 9).                                                                                                                                                              | Structuring elements and the images after dilation and erosion.                 |          ❌ ImageJ does not allow to modify the structuring element for binary dilation and erosion [ISSUE]           |
| **4**  | **Denoise** the image of the strengthened vertical edges by applying **linear and/or nonlinear filters of unit radius** (Chapter 5). Make sure the image stays **binary** after denoising.                                                                                                                                            | The filter(s) and kernel(s), and the denoised image of vertical edges.          |                                                          ⌛                                                           |
| **5**  | To detect text regions (which have a high-frequency structure), apply the **Bandpass Filter**. Try different values for **large structures** and **small structures limits** (e.g., 40 and 30 pixels) to produce horizontally aligned regions that resemble words or entire text lines (Chapter 19).                                  | The filtered image.                                                             |                                                          ⌛                                                           |
| **6**  | If necessary, use the filtered image from step 5 as a **binary mask** for the denoised image of the vertical edges from step 4 by applying the **AND operation**.                                                                                                                                                                     | The masked image.                                                               |                                                          ⌛                                                           |
| **7**  | If step 6 was implemented, apply the same **Bandpass Filter** from step 5 to the masked image.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | The filtered masked image.                                                      |                                                          ⌛                                                           |
| **8**  | **Analyze the particles** in the filtered image from step 5 or step 7 and show the **fitting ellipses** (Chapter 10).                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | The image with fitting ellipses of the analyzed particles.                      |                                                          ⌛                                                           |
