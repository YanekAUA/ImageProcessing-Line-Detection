# Text Line Recognition Project
<!-- 
The Project aims at detection / recognition of stone inscriptions. Due to weathering, vandalism,
erosion, and the complexity of ancient scripts, many of these texts are hard to read. Study, apply
and test Image Processing methods and algorithms to detect Armenian inscriptions.
The shapes of Armenian letters are based on vertical strokes. Based on this observation, implement
and test a pipeline outlined below. Implement the steps as ImageJ plug-ins or menu commands,
and save them using the ImageJ macro recorder. In addition to the recorded macro(s), submit the
code of all implemented plug-ins. Other image processing and programming environments may
be used only for testing purposes. -->

|  12   | Produce a right-side projection visualization to verify detected lines.         | `Right Projection` plugin on final filtered image to compute horizontal projection highlighting line alignments.                                                                    | `16-Right-Projection.tif`                                               |   ✅    |

Notes:
- Intermediate TIFFs are saved in `.tmp/<image>/` with descriptive names for traceability.
- Bandpass filter sizes are computed from image height (`BP5_large`, `BP5_small`, `BP7_large`, `BP7_small`) so the pipeline adapts to scale.
- Convolution kernels and morphological steps are implemented inline in the macro; Hough and mapping require the `plugins/` Java filters (e.g., `Hough_Transform.java`, `Hough_To_BoundingBox.java`, `Horizontal_Elbow_Filter.java`, `Right_Projection.java`).
